# Phishing-detection-using-AI
Decision Tree and SVM(Support Vector Machine) AI algorithms to detect phishing emails

## Explanation
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. SVM works by finding the hyperplane in a high-dimensional space that maximally separates the different classes. The points closest to the hyperplane are called support vectors, and the distance between the hyperplane and the support vectors is called the margin. SVM tries to maximize the margin in order to find the best hyperplane.

Decision Tree is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification or regression tasks. It works by constructing a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. Decision Tree makes predictions based on the values of the features in the data, and it can handle categorical and numerical data.

## Usage
First of all everything here is developed using Python language, help of `CSV` file for dataset and we used VSCode, so you need to have python installed in your device also u need to have `pip` installed.
We used some libraries that are needed to implement these 2 algorithms, they can be installed in VSCode terminal or in shell just u need to run as administrator
and then you write like this for each one:
`pip install pandas`
`pip install -U scikit-learn`
After you get these libraries I believe you will be ok to run the python file. In this code we didn't get so deep into AI so we just wanted to make AI predict phishing in our dataset of emails. Our dataset has 4 features which we think are enough for good results but u can add more if u want. Also if you take code just let credits and you can easily change, modify, copy or anything else that u need.
