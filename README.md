# Phishing-detection-using-AI
Decision Tree and SVM(Support Vector Machine) AI algorithms to detect phishing emails

## Usage
First of all everything here is developed using Python language, help of `CSV` file for dataset and we used VSCode, so you need to have python installed in your device also u need to have `pip` installed.
We used some libraries that are needed to implement these 2 algorithms, they can be installed in VSCode terminal or in shell just u need to run as administrator
and then you write like this for each one:
`pip install pandas`
`pip install -U scikit-learn`
After you get these libraries I believe you will be ok to run the python file. In this code we didn't get so deep into AI so we just wanted to make AI predict phishing in our dataset of emails. Our dataset has 4 features which we think are enough for good results but u can add more if u want. Also if you take code just let credits and you can easily change, modify, copy or anything else that u need.
